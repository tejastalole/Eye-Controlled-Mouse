Project Name : Eye-Controlled Mouse Using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI

This project implements an eye-controlled mouse that allows users to move the cursor and perform clicks using only their eye movements. It leverages OpenCV for video processing, MediaPipe for facial landmark detection, and PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse actions. The project captures real-time video from a webcam, detects facial landmarks, and maps eye movement to screen coordinates for cursor control.
